                    <h3><u>What is GIMP?</u></h3>
                        <p>GIMP is a free, open-source image editing platform. The program packs an array of professional-quality features which can genuinely rival Adobes Photoshop capabilities. Itsremarkable montage features allow the user to easily fine tune photos/images and createartwork from scratch. The selection includes noise reduction, cropping, automatic image
                            enhancement tools, color adjustment tools, gradients, customizable brushes, and much more.</p>
                        <p>GIMP also provides plenty of features for the advanced user including filters, Bezier curves,layer masks, and an animation package. Its support for pre-installed or downloadable plugins is also commendable. Overall, the software is a force to reckon with among the bestfree image editing applications, and the ideal package for geek photographers who like to
                            keep their editing space under control.</p>    

                    <h3><u>Overview of GIMP Benefits:</u></h3>
                        <p>GIMP is a cross-platform image editing solution that leads the arena of similar open source programs. It gives the user the freedom to manipulate its source code and distribute thechanges. The application is 100% free, but that doesn’t mean it compromises on its features. It packs a punch in terms of quality features that make it the best free alternative to popular
                            commercial-grade tools like Adobe Photoshop. GIMP provides all the sophisticated tools to the delight of photographers, graphic designers, and illustrators looking for the most convenient way to get the job done.</p>
                        <p>The program features a standard interface that conforms to the high-end graphics program layout. The GU interface is crafted to be cleaner and drive improved performance. Upon closer examination, you will notice the UI is divided into three parts. There is the main editing area, toolbox, and layer, paths, undo, and channels. The image tabs display vital image
                             thumbnails, unlike in other programs which just display the name.</p>
                        <p>Although GIMP lacks the depth of the commercial photo editing programs, it provides all the essential editing features, commands, and tools. In addition, the software goes beyond the basics to provide some advanced editing tools like channel manipulation. Its “open as layers” command is a noteworthy feature which enables users to map an image into the layer of
                            another.</p>
                        <p>Besides being an open source program, GIMP is easily extensible. It allows the user to enhance productivity via many customization options and its support for third-party plugins.
                                Its active community of developers has engineered a wide array of plugins.</p>

                                    <li>While GIMP is available from a lot of sites (since it’s free and open source software), I
                                        recommend only downloading it from the official repository at GIMP.org to make sure you
