                    <h3>Technology in Modern World</h3>
                    <p>Technology is developing day by day but what about human beings? Technology is to develop human beings .human beings are not using that powerful weapon.Just think the power of the smartphone we are using.No Iam not talking about playing pubg.It has the power greater than computer used by NASA in 1969 and  for what purpose we are using it. For time pass isn’t it.Think about purposes for which we use our smartphones just scrolling, liking,commenting and we are purposefully forgetting the fact that the solution for millions of problems are in our hand or weapon to solve that problem is in our hand. here the problem is we are not finding any problem, sorry we have many problems right?. Our likes are decreasing,followers in insta is not increasing,not getting enough comments in facebook. Just think what it will give in future, nothing... we are not able to find real problems,even though if we found one we are not ready to solve it.Fact is that the solution is already in our hand our duty is to find problems.</p>
                    <p>SMARTPHONES: It can solve real world problems. In olden days if we want to know something about someone we used write letters it takes lots of time then we starting talking to them and get instant replay,then started messaging,then sharing photos, finally now we can talk to them like as they are infront of us.Now a days technology is developing in each second. We have to be aware of another side of technology HACKING. Earlier they are used to hack our smartphones but now they are hacking human beings.Each likes we give in social medias is weapon to destroy us.Every thing is noted even the way of scrolling.Your smartphone knows everything about you even more than you.In future there will be machine to control you it will decide what you have to do.Our Mobile number is sufficient to hack our bank account.we are using many apps in our smartphones for some purpose but we are not aware of the other things they do.We are agreeing everything even without reading it,allows to access our camera, allows to access our contacts,gallery etc.. most of the apps asks this permission and we are clicking on agree but we never think why?We never ask why and now it’s too late just think if it is impossible to access our mobile how a contact named UIDAI added on our mobile without our knowledge. </p>
                    <p>Next is artificial intelligence while you watch shows,videos you are also watched all your expressions are watched,things that Brings you happiness,anger,sad are also noted.It is more than enough to hack you.Even in chess game if someone makes a great moves it is treated as faul because it had been already trademarks of computers and accepted humans are not able to do that.In future machines will get to every profession teachers,doctors,drivers,managers etc..and they are of machines. Master the technology before they master us.</p>
