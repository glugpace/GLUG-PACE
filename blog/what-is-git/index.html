    <title>GLUG PACE - What is Git (Version Control System)?</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Git is a version-control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision-control system, it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

                    <p>Git is a version-control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision-control system, it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. There are multiple Version Control Systems, but Git is by far and large the most popularâ€Šboth for individual and company use.</p>
                    <p>Git was created by Linus TorvaldsðŸ˜‡ in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.</p>
                    <p>Version control is the only reasonable way to keep track of changes in code, manuscripts, presentations, and data analysis projects. I used to make numbered tar.gz files for a project. But exploring the differences is difficult, to say the least. And if you use git properly, youâ€™ll have annotated each small change. Unless you can write something perfectly the first time, you need to have a version control system ðŸ˜œ.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Git repositories</h3>
                    <p>A Git repository contains the history of a collection of files starting from a certain directory. The process of copying an existing Git repository via the Git tooling is called cloning. After cloning a repository the user has the complete repository with its history on his/her local machine. Of course, Git also supports the creation of new repositories.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The concept of branches</h3>
                    <p>Git supports branching which means that you can work on different versions of your collection of files. A branch allows the user to switch between these versions so that he can work on different changes independently from each other.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you want to develop a new feature, you can create a branch and make the changes in this branch. This does not affect the state of your files in other branches. For example, you can work independently on a branch called production for bugfixes and on another branch called new_feature for implementing a new feature.</p>
                    <p>Ok, I think it's more than enough for you to understand What <b>Git</b> is. Hereâ€™s an awesome (free!) interactive tutorial sponsored by GitHub where you can learn all of the basics: <a href="https://try.github.io/" class="link" target="blank">try.github.io</a></p>
                    <p>Also participate in our event on Git & GitHub 101 to know more about Git and it's uses ðŸ˜ƒ.</p>
