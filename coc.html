    <title>GLUG PACE - Code Of Conduct</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Git is a version-control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision-control system, it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. There are multiple Version Control Systems, but Git is by far and large the most popular both for individual and company use.">

                    <h3>Enforcement Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p>Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

                    <p>Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    
                    <h3>Scope</h3>
                    <p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    
                    <h3>Enforcement</h3>

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.</p>
                    
                    <br><br>

                    Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

                    <p>Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.<br>
